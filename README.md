# poc-dockerized-database-integration-tests-atlassian-plugin

A simple Proof of Concept on how to run **Database Integration Tests with real dockerized PostgreSQL or MySQL Databases during Atlassian JIRA Plugin development**.
This PoC is based on **[UnitTests for Active Objects](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/testing/)**. 

&nbsp;

### Prerequisites

 * Docker is installed and on PATH
 * Java 8 JDK is installed and on PATH
 * [Atlassian Plugin SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project/) is installed and on PATH

&nbsp;

### Running the Tests

Simply run:

```
atlas-unit-test
```

Why not `atlas-integration-test`? Because even though it is named 'integration-test' it starts a full JIRA instance
and runs tests against it. We only want to instantiate Active Objects with a real database and not the whole JIRA context.
That is why we use the `atlas-unit-test` command.
